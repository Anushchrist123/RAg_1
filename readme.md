# ðŸ“„ PDF Q&A System with Groq AI (Using FAISS)

## Overview

This project is a **PDF-based Q&A system** that extracts text from PDFs, processes queries using FAISS for similarity search, and generates responses using the **Groq AI API**. It includes an interactive Streamlit UI and export options for saving results as Word documents or PDFs.

## Features

- **Upload and extract text** from PDF documents.
- **Tokenize and split text** into smaller chunks for processing.
- **Create vector embeddings** using `sentence-transformers` and index them with **FAISS** for efficient search.
- **Answer queries** using the **Groq AI API** based on relevant document content.
- **Handle financial calculations** separately by providing components, formulas, and results.
- **Export responses** as Word documents, PDFs, or print them directly.
